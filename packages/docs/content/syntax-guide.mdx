# Syntax Guide

This page explains the syntax of `.abell` files

## JS-in-HTML Syntax

In `.abell` files you can write JavaScript code inside the double curly braces.

This code gets evaluated during build-time and the output is injected into HTML.

```abell
<body>{{ 2 + 1 }}</body>
// Outputs: <body>3</body>
```

## Imports

Imports are allowed in the first block in the file. You can import anything that Vite allows you to import.

```abell
{{
  import { add } from './calculate.ts';
}}

<body>{{ add(2, 1) }}</body>
```

You can also extend the type of files you can import using Vite Plugins. E.g. You can use [vite-plugin-md-to-html](https://github.com/saurabhdaware/vite-plugin-md-to-html) to use `.md` imports

## Declarations

In Abell, you can mark a block as declaration block using `// declarations` comment

```abell
{{
  // declarations
  const a = 3;
  const b = 9;
}}
<body>{{ a + b }}</body>
```

<details>
<summary>This is required because in JavaScript, assignments return values which abell might try to print unless `// declarations` comment is used</summary>

By default Abell tries to print the output of expression inside Abell block. Which means sometimes the default behaviour might be unexpected. E.g. -

```abell
{{
  let a;
  a = 4;
}}
<body>{{ a }}</body>

// Outputs - "4<body>4</body>"
```

This is because in JavaScript, the assignment operator returns the value as well which Abell will try to print unless `// declarations` comment is used

</details>

## Loops & Conditions

You can use `.map` to loop over array. You can also ternary operators for any conditions.

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: editor(loopsAndConditions) }} />

But... What if I hate writing `.map`? or using ternary operators in complex conditions?

## Immediately Invoked Function Expressions

In Abell, if you write a function in abell block, It automatically gets invoked with empty params.

Which means if you don't like writing `.map` or using ternary operators, You can write the good old `For` loops or `if-else` conditions inside function and return the value you want to print.

<div
  dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: editor(immediatelyInvokedFunctions) }}
/>
