# Custom Routing

Want to build custom blog pages? or just hate file-system routing? this page is for you!

## Why Custom Routing?

Abell by default enables a file-system routing to get you started quickly. However there are multiple cases where your routing logic might be far too complex (e.g. building blog pages from a route configuration object), or maybe you just don't like the filesystem routing.

Abell gives you an option to opt-out of this file-system-based routing behaviour and go wild with your routing needs ðŸ«¡

## The `makeRoutes` API to the Rescue

With Abell, you can define a `entry.build.ts` file that exports a function called `makeRoutes`. In this you define a path and HTML string that it should return.

Fun part?? This lets you return ANY html string HOWEVER you want. Which means, I can also opt-out of `.abell` files themselves and use Abell just as a router ðŸ¤¯

Checkout the `/about` route below which renders page by returning raw HTML

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: editor(routingExample) }} />

Giving Routing as a JavaScript logic also enables you to do fun dynamic things before creating routes such as creating new routes for your blog

<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: editor(blogRoutingExample) }} />

## API Props Definitions

```ts
type Route = {
  /** path on which you want your page to render */
  path: string;

  /** render function that expects raw HTML string in return */
  render: () => string;

  /** Configuration Options for Route  */
  routeOptions?: {
    /**
     * option to create a `<path>.html` file
     * or create directory with index.html inside it
     *
     * @default '[route].html'
     */
    outputPathPattern?: '[route].html' | '[route]/index.html';
  };
};

export const makeRoutes = () => Route[];
```
